# Gestion de Aeropuertos y Vuelos

This is a Java application to manage information about airports and flights. It allows to create, read, update and delete information about airports and flights and also to create passengers and assign them to a flight.

This application uses the following technologies:

- Java 8
- MySQL for data storage
- Swing for the user interface
- JDBC for database connections

To run the application, you need to have Java 8 and a MySQL server installed in your computer. You also need to import the sql script located in the sql folder into your MySQL server.

Once you have the script imported, you can compile and run the application. The application will create a window with 7 tabs, each one for a different functionality.
