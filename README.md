# Airport and Flight Management

This is a Java application to manage information about airports and flights. It allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting information about airports and flights, as well as creating passengers and assigning them to a flight.

This application uses the following technologies:

- Java 8
- MySQL for data storage
- Swing for the user interface
- JDBC for database connections

To run the application, you need to have Java 8 and a MySQL server installed on your computer. You also need to import the SQL script located in the `sql` folder into your MySQL server.

Once you have the script imported, you can compile and run the application. The application will create a window with 7 tabs, each one for a different functionality.

The following images show the application in action:
